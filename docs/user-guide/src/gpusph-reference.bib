	abstract = {The present paper aims at proposing a fast algorithm permitting to detect the free-surface in particle simulations,
and next to define a level-set function on a cartesian grid. The latter allows for analyzing in detail the free surface shape of three-dimensional simulations as well as internal features of the flow, by using standard visualization tools. The algorithms proposed for detecting the free-surface particles are described in both two and three dimensions, and are validated on simple and complex flow simulations. Then, the derivation of the level-set function is detailed and the usefulness of the proposed method to post-process and analyze complex flows are illustrated on realistic 2D and 3D examples.},

techniques to recover analytical expressions for the physical variables

take the form of Newtonian equations for particles. Starting with a
nonaxisymmetric distribution of approximately 80 particles in three
dimensions, the method is found to reproduce the structure of uniformly
rotating and magnetic polytropes to within a few percent. The method may
be easily extended to deal with more complicated physical models.},

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with approximating arbitrarily shaped boundaries in SPH simulations. We model the boundaries by means of boundary particles which exert forces on a fluid. We show that, when these forces are chosen correctly, and the boundary particle spacing is a factor of 2 (or more) less than the fluid particle spacing, the total boundary force on a fluid SPH particle is perpendicular to boundaries with negligible error. Furthermore, the variation in the force as a fluid particle moves, while keeping a fixed distance from the boundary, is also negligible. The method works equally well for convex or concave boundaries. The new boundary forces simplify SPH algorithms and are superior to other methods for simulating complicated boundaries. We apply the new method to (a) the rise of a cylinder contained in a curved basin, (b) the spin down of a fluid in a cylinder, and (c) the oscillation of a cylinder inside a larger fixed cylinder. The results of the simulations are in good agreement with those obtained using other methods, but with the advantage that they are very simple to implement.},

After a sudden removal of the lock gate, a gravity current, undular bore, or solitary wave develops, depending on the ambient fluid height in the channel. The temporal evolution of the moving front has been measured and evaluated. It was observed that the dilution using a very small amount (a few weight ppm) of a long chain polymer (polyethylene-oxide) in the fluid strongly affected flow properties. Pronounced drag reduction has been found in dry bed flows (whereas the polymer increased the viscosity of the fluid). The presence of a few mm-thick ambient fluid layer in the channel effectively destroyed drag reduction, in spite of the fact that strong turbulence was obvious and the propagation velocity of the front was almost unchanged.},
